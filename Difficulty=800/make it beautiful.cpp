// If we put the maximum in the array on the first position, then for every element,
// starting from the third one, the sum of elements before it will be greater than it 
//(since that sum is greater than the maximum value in the array). 
//So, the only element that can make our array ugly is the second element. 
//We need to make sure that it is not equal to the first element.

// Let's put the maximum element on the first position, the minimum element on the second position, 
//and then fill the rest of the array arbitrarily. 
//The only case when it fails is when the maximum element is equal to the minimum elementâ€” 
//and it's easy to see that if the maximum is equal to the minimum, 
//then the first element of the array will be equal to the second element no matter what, 
//and the array cannot become beautiful.

// So, the solution is to check if the maximum is different from the minimum, and if it is so,
// put them on the first two positions, and the order of remaining elements does not matter.
// Note that the given array is sorted, so the minimum is the first element, the maximum is the last element.
